## Habitica Auto-Ping Script  

Habitica is a productivity/habit-forming website and app that uses video game mechanics to encourage users to make changes in their real lives. Users can form parties with other members and work together with their party members to complete quests. The quests do not start until every member has responded to the quest RSVP, which means that sometimes quest starting is delayed. This script automatically sends a message in the party chat to 'ping' users who have not RSVP'd to the quest and request that they do so, so that the quest can begin.
